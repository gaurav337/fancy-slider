Problem Statement:

Develop an object detection system to identify and localize military helicopters in aerial images, classifying them as friendly or enemy and triggering alerts for enemy aircraft.
Description:

In this project, Guardians of Skies, we develop an intelligent aerial surveillance system to protect Egyptian airspace.  Leveraging advanced object detection techniques, our system identifies and localizes military helicopters in aerial imagery, categorizing them as friendly or enemy.  The system triggers alerts for enemy aircraft, ensuring airspace security and contributing to national defense.

By utilizing modern computer vision and deep learning models, we aim to provide a robust solution for real-time aerial threat detection. The system will process aerial images, detect helicopters, and classify them, providing an efficient and scalable solution for airspace monitoring and security.
Outline of the Project:
1. Data Collection & Preprocessing

    Utilize the provided aerial image dataset.
    Categorize the dataset into friendly and enemy aircraft for training and testing.
    Perform data augmentation to enhance model robustness and generalization.
    Annotate images to create bounding boxes around helicopters and label them as friendly or enemy.

2. Model Development & Training

    Implement state-of-the-art object detection models such as:
        YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time detection capabilities.
        Faster R-CNN for high-accuracy helicopter recognition and classification.
        SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) for a balance of speed and accuracy.
    Train models using transfer learning on pre-trained architectures like ResNet and EfficientNet.
    Optimize model performance by tuning hyperparameters and using techniques like data augmentation and dropout regularization.

3. Post-processing & Evaluation

    Compute metrics such as:
        Intersection over Union (IoU) for object localization accuracy.
        Mean Average Precision (mAP) for overall detection and classification performance.
    Apply Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to refine bounding box predictions and reduce redundancy.
    Conduct extensive validation using confusion matrices and precision-recall curves to assess model reliability.

4. Deployment & Alert System

    Develop a system to trigger real-time alerts upon detection of enemy helicopters.
    Explore options for deploying the model on edge devices or cloud platforms for practical application.
    Optimize inference time for near real-time performance in aerial surveillance scenarios.
    Consider developing a user interface to visualize detected helicopters and alerts.
